# Privacy Policy – GenZ AI Tutor (AskDiya)

**Effective date:** 06 Jan 2026

GenZ AI Tutor (“the App”) is operated by **GenzAI** (“we”, “our”, “us”).
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the App.

## Information we collect
### 1) Phone number (OTP login)
We collect your phone number to authenticate you using OTP and to secure your account.

### 2) Microphone / Audio (Voice features)
If you choose to use voice input features, the App requests microphone permission (**RECORD_AUDIO**).
Audio is recorded **only when you tap the microphone button**.
We do not store raw audio permanently. Audio may be processed temporarily during your request.
Audio is used only to convert speech to text and respond to your request.

### 3) Usage and diagnostics
We may collect basic app usage and diagnostic information (such as crash logs) to improve stability and performance.

### 4) Advertising data (AdMob)
We use Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect advertising identifiers (such as the Google Advertising ID), IP address, and approximate location to show and measure ads, and to prevent fraud.

## How we use your information
- Provide login and account access (OTP)
- Enable voice input and voice-based features
- Improve app performance, reliability, and user experience
- Prevent misuse and fraud

## Sharing of information
We may share information with service providers that help us run the App, such as:
- **Firebase (Google)** for authentication and database/storage
- **Google Gemini** for voice/AI processing (if applicable)
- **Google AdMob** for displaying and measuring ads


We do not sell your personal information.

## Data retention
We retain information only as long as needed to provide the service and comply with legal obligations.
- Phone number and account data are retained while your account is active.
- Voice audio is not stored permanently; it may be processed temporarily to complete your request.
- Diagnostic logs may be retained for a limited time to troubleshoot issues.

## Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data.

## Children’s privacy
The App is intended for educational use. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

## Your choices
- You can deny microphone permission in device settings; voice features will not work without it.
